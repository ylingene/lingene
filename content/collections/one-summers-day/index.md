The portrayal of Japanese summer in anime&mdash;towering cumulonimbus clouds, buzzing cicadas, and sweltering
heat&mdash;has always captivated me. After experiencing it for myself, I've come to embrace the brutal beauty
of the season despite often ending the day exhausted and soaked in sweat. I loved capturing fluffy white clouds,
lush green rice fields, and serene seaside views.

The photos in this collection features scenes from Izu Peninsula, the Seto Inland Sea, Kagawa, Okayama,
Nagasaki, Ishikawa, Gifu, Tokyo, and Hokkaido. They depict a summer's day in Japan.

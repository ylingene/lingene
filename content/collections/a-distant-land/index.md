I split my first visit to Europe between wandering a metropolis of diverse architecture and
what felt like venturing into a fairytale. I spent countless hours at parks in Paris, watching
people come and go, seeing the sunlight slowly shift across the ground, and enjoying time
passing. In Switzerland, I was in awe of the natural beauty of the valleys, mountains, and
alpine lakes and the lives people have built in these picturesque locations.

This photo collection features scenes from Paris and Lauterbrunnen Valley, Bern, Gruyères, Lake
Thun, Appenzell (Saxer Lücke), Lucerne, and Zurich in Switzerland.

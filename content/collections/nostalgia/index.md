Home is surviving the stifling hot and humid summers and frigid winters. But it is also taking
peaceful walks on a summer evening after the heat recedes and feeling alive, breathing
in the crisp, dry air on a sunny winter day. It is walking through a sea of vibrant, blooming flowers in
spring and warm, colorful leaves in autumn. Home is the charming seasonal life on the East Coast.

The memories of home span the past four years, from 2021 to 2025, but this collection will
continue to evolve as I revisit home. They include scenes from Massachusetts, Washington D.C.,
New York, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont.

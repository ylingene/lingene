Moving to California has been a new chapter in both my photography and life. When I first began
photography, my photo subject matter gradually transitioned from people to everyday
environments.


I'm inspired by background environments in film and animation. Some notable works have been
Makoto Shinkai's Your Name and Kyoto Animation's Violet Evergarden. The photos here were taken
while I have lived in California since 2018. Places include San Francisco and San Diego.
